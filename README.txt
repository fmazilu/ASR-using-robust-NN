Automatic Speech Recognition using robust Neural Networks

This approach takes two common ASR tasks: speech recognition and speaker recognition; and proposes a solution using Lipschitz constrained Neural Networks. 
A comparison is made between unconstrained and constrained models, further reading is provided in each folders' README.

The speech recognition project is found in the "Voice digit recogniton" folder and it uses Google's Speech Commands data set found here: http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz
with further information here: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands

The speaker recognition project is found in the "Speaker recognition" folder and it uses RoDigits speech corpus found here: https://speed.pub.ro/downloads/speech-datasets/

The processed data sets are provided in this repository such that the download of the audio data sets is not needed.
